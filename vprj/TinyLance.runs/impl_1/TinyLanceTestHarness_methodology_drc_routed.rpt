2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-16#1 Warning
Address collision  
Block RAM TestHarness/tile/dcache/data/data_arrays_0_0_reg may get memory collision error if read and write address collide. Use of address collision resolution circuitry is recommended.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-16#2 Warning
Address collision  
Block RAM TestHarness/tile/dcache/data/data_arrays_0_1_reg may get memory collision error if read and write address collide. Use of address collision resolution circuitry is recommended.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-16#3 Warning
Address collision  
Block RAM TestHarness/tile/dcache/data/data_arrays_0_2_reg may get memory collision error if read and write address collide. Use of address collision resolution circuitry is recommended.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-16#4 Warning
Address collision  
Block RAM TestHarness/tile/dcache/data/data_arrays_0_3_reg may get memory collision error if read and write address collide. Use of address collision resolution circuitry is recommended.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-16#5 Warning
Address collision  
Block RAM TestHarness/tile/frontend/icache/data_arrays_0_0_reg may get memory collision error if read and write address collide. Use of address collision resolution circuitry is recommended.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-16#6 Warning
Address collision  
Block RAM TestHarness/tile/frontend/icache/tag_array_0_reg may get memory collision error if read and write address collide. Use of address collision resolution circuitry is recommended.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_slow_SlowClock and clk_slow_SlowClock_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_slow_SlowClock] -to [get_clocks clk_slow_SlowClock_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_slow_SlowClock_1 and clk_slow_SlowClock are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_slow_SlowClock_1] -to [get_clocks clk_slow_SlowClock]
Related violations: <none>
